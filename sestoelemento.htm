The Lamborghini Sesto Elemento ("Sixth Element" in Italian) is a two-door, two-seater, V10 high-performance lightweight limited edition car produced by Italian automaker Lamborghini, which debuted at the 2010 Paris Motor Show.<p><center><img src="Lamborghini-Sesto-Elemento-front-view (1).jpg" width=98% border=4></center></p> The Sesto Elemento's name is a reference to the atomic number of carbon, in recognition of the car's extensive use of carbon fiber.

The Sesto Elemento is equipped with a 6-speed semi-automatic transmission with paddle shift and all wheel drive system, mated to a 5.2 litre V10 engine borrowed from the Gallardo, generating 578 PS (425 kW; 570 hp) and 540 N•m (400 lbf•ft) of torque. The chassis, body, drive shaft and suspension components are made of carbon fiber, reducing the overall weight to a mere 999 kilograms (2,202 lb), a weight comparable to subcompact cars such as a Honda Fit. It is the lightest car Lamborghini has ever produced.

Air is released through 10 distinctive hexagonal holes in the engine cover, while two intakes funnel cool air into the mid-mounted engine compartment. The Sesto Elemento's high amount of horsepower combined with low overall weight translate to a power-to-weight ratio of 0.57 hp/kg (0.26 hp/lb) (with a weight-to-power ratio of 1.75 kg/hp and 3.85 lb/hp). Lamborghini claims a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration time of just 2.5 seconds.
