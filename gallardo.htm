The Lamborghini Gallardo is a sports car built by Lamborghini, their most-produced model to date with over 10,000 built in its first seven years of production. Named after a famous breed of fighting bull, the V-10 Gallardo has been Lamborghini's sales leader and stable-mate to a succession of V-12 flagship models—first to the Lamborghini Murciélago (4,099 built between 2001 and 2011), then to the current flagship Lamborghini Aventador.

Presented at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, the Gallardo LP 560-4 is a significant refresh of the Gallardo, powered by a new 5.2 L (320 cu in) V10 engine that produces 560 PS (412 kW; 552 hp) at 8,000 rpm and 540 N·m (398 lb·ft) at 6,500 rpm of torque. Featuring "Iniezione Diretta Stratificata" direct fuel injection system to improve efficiency; fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have been reduced by 18% despite the increase in performance. It also has a new design inspired by the Murciélago LP 670 and Reventon.

The new engine, 40 PS (29 kW; 39 hp) more powerful than in the previous car, comes with two transmission choices: 6-speed manual or 6-speed E-gear, the later of which was revised to offer a Corsa mode which makes 40% quicker shifts than before and decreases traction control restrictions, a Thrust Mode launch control system was also added. Accompanied with a 20 kg (44 lb) weight reduction all the improvements add up to a claimed performance of 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.7 seconds, 0-200 km/h (120 mph) of 11.8 and a top speed of 325 km/h (202 mph).
